	hint:have frackman create squirt then have studentworld manage the rest

	turn frackman to that direction, but do not move
	if (same direction && frackman is able to move in that direction(no rocks in the way and not out of the game area))
	use graphObject's moveTo() to move 1 square in that direction
	////////////valid positions are from 0-60 inclusive for both x and y, frackman cannot go <= radius of 3 from center of rock////////
	if (z or Z && frackman has at least 1 sonar)
	use sonar to illuminate within a radius of 12 around him (includes 11.99)
	decrease sonar count by 1
	setVisible() all hidden game objects within a radius of 12
	if (tab && frackman has at least 1 gold)
	add gold object to the current x,y location
	reduce gold count by 1
	////////the gold nugget will start out visible but only live for 100 ticks, it can only be picked up by protesters/////////
